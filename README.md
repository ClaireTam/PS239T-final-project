# PS23T-final-project
# In my project I use webscraping to extract data from WikiLeaks (https://wikileaks.org/irq/sort/category/supporting_aif_0.html). I use Python to extract the data and latitude and longitudinal data on Anti-Iraq Forces attacks from 2004-2009. After constructing a dataset of these attacks, I use R to plot the attacks on a map of Iraq.
